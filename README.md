# Data-Structure---The-Selection-Problem
Solved by three different algoritms - Insertion, Selection and Median of medians.
 
Purpose of the Project: Realizing the problem of Selection by three different algorithms and comparing their efficiency.
There are three main functions that aim to find the number by index of size.
From an unsorted group of different numbers from each other. 
The first function you will find in it can be an algorithm
That implement Insertion sort.
The second algoritm will be Selection Sort .
The third will find it could be the  Median of medians algorithm.
